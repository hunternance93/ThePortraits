    a review!!! \n\nA few house rules:\n1. No shoes inside! Please leave them at

    with you, we don't want anything going bad in the fridge!\n\nThanks,\nThe Davidsons\n\nP.S.
    On the off-chance that the power is out when you get there (sadly our power company
    sucks!) there is a backup generator in the basement. If it is out of fuel, there
    should be extra in the pantry."
