I was supposed to be home hours ago.

It was a simple gig, but many hours away, in a small town I had never been.

A few hours on my ride back my truck started acting up, and I had to stop by the mechanic. I spent an arm and a leg but it seemed to be fixed, and it wasn't till 9PM that they were done with 6 hours left to drive. 

I continued the drive home, but all at once it hit me just how much I had been overworked lately. I was exhausted. I nearly swerved into oncoming traffic and realized I couldn't make it.

There was only one hotel in this town and it was being renovated, so I had to get an AirBNB.

There was only one available, $130 a night before fees, and with a rating of 1.2. Unbelievable, but can't be worse than some of the places I have stayed.

It was down a long, winding road in the woods. Eventually, the path narrowed so much that I couldn't take my truck any further.

I followed the path another half mile until finally I see it. More a cabin than a house, really. 

I typed in the keycode on the lockbox by the front door. After three tries it opened, and I grabbed the key, and went inside the shit-hole.
