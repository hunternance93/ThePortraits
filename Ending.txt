I slam the door behind me and run as fast as I have in my life.

I run as fast I have in my life down that winding path, all the while hearing something following.

And then more and more footsteps and inhuman noises.

Finally, I see my truck in the distance!

I fumble with the keys but get it unlocked and hop in.

I slam the keys into the ignitition and turn.

Start!!

START, YOU PIECE OF SHIT!!!

I see eyes in the distance, those same horrible portraits closing in slowly behind the trees.

START!!!
